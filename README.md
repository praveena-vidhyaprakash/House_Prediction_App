# House Prediction App

A Python-based machine learning application that predicts house prices based on input features like area, bedrooms, and location.

## Features
- Predicts house prices using a trained ML regression model.
- Beginner-friendly interface (CLI or optional web interface).
- Includes both training and inference scripts for flexibility.
